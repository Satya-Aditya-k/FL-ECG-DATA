> **Privacy-preserving federated learning for 12-lead ECG classification across heterogeneous devices and sites.**  
> Simulates different variants, IID ,non-IID ECG clients and also based on scaling(centralized/distributed scaling of data), harmonizes heterogeneous signals, and evaluates federated strategies vs. centralized baselines.

## ðŸ”Ž Short abstract
This repository provides code, notebooks and scripts to experiment with federated learning (FL) on multi-source 12-lead ECG datasets. It focuses on realistic heterogeneity (different sampling rates, noise, lengths and class distributions) and compares FL algorithms (FedAvg and heterogeneity-aware variants such as FedProx / FedDyn) against centralized baselines using clinically relevant metrics.

## âœ¨ Key features
- **Heterogeneous client simulation** â€” build realistic non-IID nodes from public ECG collections.  
- **Modular preprocessing** â€” resampling, denoising, normalization, time/frequency features.  
- **Federated algorithms** â€” FedAvg, FedProx, FedDyn (and configurable variants).  
- **Evaluation suite** â€” Accuracy, F1, Sensitivity, Specificity and convergence analysis.  
- **Notebooks & scripts** â€” reproducible workflows for preprocessing â†’ training â†’ evaluation.
